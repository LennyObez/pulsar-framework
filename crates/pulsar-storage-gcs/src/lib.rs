//! Google Cloud Storage backend for pulsar-storage.
//!
//! v2.3 sqlx-pattern driver crate per Decision 2.51. Each backend driver
//! lives in its own crate so its CVE history, semver discipline, and
//! audit trail are independent of sibling drivers.
//!
//! See `docs/plan.md` Section IV.21.3 + Section V.3E.X.
//!
//! Placeholder release for namespace reservation. The implementation ships in `0.1.0`.
